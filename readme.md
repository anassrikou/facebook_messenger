##messenger app built with JS and Facebook JS SDK.

### the what, why and how
#### what is this?
this is just a simple application built with javascript to receive a facebook messages coming from clients.

#### why?
it is part of my work (not really a private stuff) any customer who choose to use this app will be able to receive
messages without having to keep a facebook page open.
it's like messenger but for facebook page.

#### how?
this project depends on nodejs to work, so please make sure that you have it or install it (v8.11 or later)

1. create new file name config.js inside the src folder
2. change config.sample.js to config.js and replace the variables accordingly
3. npm install
4. npm start

#### notice
- since this project is part of something bigger there are some calls to backend server (php) to save data in mysql.
- I have a todo list of things I'm currently doing that I update on every commit
